Today the first, and hopefully last, Release Candidate version of ROM 1.0.0 was released. If you're running on beta or older versions now it's a really good moment to upgrade. This release only includes one [small bug fix](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom/issues/311).

For more information please refer to the [previous announcement](/blog/2015/11/24/first-beta-of-rom-1-0-0-has-been-released/).

As part of this release other gems have been upgraded too:

- rom 1.0.0.rc1
- rom-support 1.0.0.rc1
- rom-mapper 0.3.0.rc1
- rom-model 0.2.0.rc1
- rom-rails 0.6.0.rc1
- rom-sql 0.7.0.rc1
- rom-repository 0.2.0.rc1

These are pre-releases which means you need to add them explicitly to your Gemfile. If you're having problem with upgrading [report an issue](https://github.com/rom-rb/rom/issues), ask for help on [gitter](https://gitter.im/rom-rb/chat) or post a message on [the forum](http://discuss.rom-rb.org).

The final version should be released on Wednesday, December 30th, unless we find some blocking issues which are hard to fix.
